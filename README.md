# TNT
some simple&naive formal proof of **trivial Number Theory**, using Agda/Coq

*just to practice skills (aka a project of **Just A Toy (JAT)** )*

## Why Agda now？
The first choice is Coq, because I cannot remember shortcuts in emacs, which is 钦定-ed by Agda used in interactive mode. (Who is Atom?)

But with a little try, I found I do not know anything about Coq.

So It is a Agda project. (Does agda have any module manager?)
